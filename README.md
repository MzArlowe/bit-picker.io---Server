# Server Build

01-28-2022
- The server has CRUD but no endpoints have been tested. Next step is to code DB Association and map out my code after DB is running. 
- This is all very exciting. 

01-31-2022
- Server is fixed. Listening on PORT 3000. All code has been pushed. Error was a file structure issue which has always been the last place I have looked in the past with these errors. Question is, "How many times will it take for me to learn this?"

Any time someone is confounded by an error when the code makes sense and should work, shift your perspective and check your file structure.

01-31-2022
- My register and login user endpoints are functioning and it's generating a token which means my auth is functioning without any glitches. 

02-01-2022
- Success with my DB associations. Got build.js and controllers working. Need only to test partController and test the delete and update components accordingly. 
- Successfully, with plenty of assistance, figured out heroku and pushed my app. 

02-03-2022
- Finally remapped my associations and got my buildId to post in Postman. Now on to figuring out GET, DELETE, & PUT. Then server will be finished.
- Server not finished. Discovered there's more to Admin that I need to learn. More on that tomorrow. Both GETS are done. Only one PUT is finished and the other is making me made. Have not tested either of my deletes. Also a job for tomorrow.

02-04-2022
- FINAL SERVER CHANGES MADE AND EVERYTHING WORKS! Tested all three deletes and final PUT. Server Complete. 

# Client Build
